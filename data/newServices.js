    title: "Before You Spend Thousands",
    description: "Not every cybersecurity challenge requires a big budget — sometimes, the smartest move is just getting the right advice first. That’s exactly why we’re called BYST: Before You Spend Thousands. You lose nothing by talking to us — it’s free, and it might save you more than you expect.",

    title: "SOC 2",
    description: "Clients want to know they can trust you with their data. SOC 2 compliance shows that your systems are secure, reliable, and designed to protect information. For many startups, it’s the first step toward landing enterprise contracts and scaling confidently. We’ve helped dozens of companies prepare for SOC 2 by running readiness assessments, fixing gaps, and working alongside developers so nothing gets overlooked. Because we know what auditors expect, we make the whole process smoother and less stressful for your team.",

    title: "ISO 27001/2",
    description: "Expanding into new markets? ISO 27001/2 is the global badge of credibility when it comes to security. It proves you’ve built a mature, well-governed program that goes beyond checklists to real risk management. Getting certified opens doors with international clients and reduces business risks. We help you put the right controls in place without drowning your team in paperwork. Our job is to make sure you get certified while staying focused on running your business.",

    title: "HIPAA",
    description: "If you’re handling health data, HIPAA isn’t optional — it’s the law. Non-compliance can mean heavy fines, lawsuits, and broken trust with patients and partners. HIPAA audits make sure your systems, policies, and staff training actually protect sensitive health information. We’ve worked with cloud environments containing hundreds of terabytes of PHI, so we know how to balance compliance with day-to-day operations. Our approach makes compliance manageable and keeps your teams confident in handling patient data securely.",

    title: "NIST 800-53",
    description: "NIST 800-53 may sound like government jargon, but it’s one of the strongest sets of security controls available. Whether you’re in the public or private sector, aligning with NIST gives you a competitive edge and strengthens your overall security posture. For startups eyeing federal contracts, it’s often a must-have. We take the complexity out of NIST and break it down into practical steps that fit your business. That way, you’re not just compliant on paper — you’re actually more secure.",

    title: "PCI DSS",
    description: "If you process credit card payments, PCI DSS protects both you and your customers from fraud and breaches. One incident can cost millions in fines and lost trust. Compliance ensures your payment systems are safe, tested, and resilient. We provide full PCI support — from vulnerability scans to penetration tests — so you know where you stand before auditors even arrive. Our clients consistently reduce audit findings and move faster toward certification.",

    title: "CMMC",
    description: "Working with the Department of Defense or its contractors? CMMC compliance is your ticket to the table. It shows you can protect sensitive government data and makes you eligible for contracts many companies can’t touch. The challenge is that CMMC builds on other frameworks like SOC 2 and NIST — which can feel overwhelming. We help bridge those gaps by building on what you already have and closing the missing pieces. The result? You walk into your certification with confidence.",

    title: "HITRUST",
    description: "HITRUST is often called the ‘all-in-one’ framework because it brings together SOC 2, HIPAA, ISO, and more under a single certification. That makes it especially valuable in healthcare and finance, where multiple compliance requirements pile up quickly. It’s complex, but it’s also one of the most respected seals of security and trust. We make HITRUST achievable by guiding you step by step and focusing on what matters most for your environment. For companies handling large amounts of PHI or PII, it’s one of the best investments you can make.",

    title: "Vulnerability Scans & Remediation",
    description: "A vulnerability scan is like a routine check-up for your IT systems. It spots weak points before attackers do, giving you the chance to fix them early. But finding issues is only half the battle — the real win comes from making sure they’re resolved properly and don’t resurface. That’s where we come in. We don’t just give you a technical report and walk away; we sit down with your team, help prioritize what matters most, and guide you through fixing it. The result? A stronger, safer environment and one less thing keeping you up at night.",
  },
  {
    image: "/assets/images/services/icon-01.png",
    title: "Penetration Testing",
    description: "Penetration testing takes things a step further. Instead of just scanning for weaknesses, we safely simulate real-world attacks to see how your systems hold up. It’s the closest thing to knowing what an attacker would do — without the actual risk. For startups, it shows investors and customers that you’re serious about security. For established companies, it confirms whether your defenses are as strong as you think they are. We deliver clear, no-fluff results and practical recommendations so you can strengthen security without slowing down the business.",
